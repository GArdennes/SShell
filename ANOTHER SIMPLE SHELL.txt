ANOTHER SIMPLE SHELL
ALGORITHM
MAIN.C
--------------------
//main entry point initializes with
argc and argv
//the code serves to check if argc == 2
//Next the second argument is run as a file, in the instance of errors an error catch is declared
//the program calls functions associated with reading information from files
//the last function (hsh) is responsible for the user interaction with the shell

SHELL_LOOP.C
--------------------
//the hsh function defines the prompt that should be displayed by the shell and the execution of the command.
//based on the arguments supplied in the main and the conditionals in the code, the function considers what other function to call

BUILTIN.C
--------------------
//The file contains function declarations for the exit, cd and help instances

BUILTIN1.C
--------------------
//The file contains function declarations that replicate the history and alias command

ENVIRON.C
--------------------
//The file contains function declarations for the setenv, unsetenv and env instances
